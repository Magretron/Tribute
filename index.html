    <li><strong>Lev Davidovich Landau (22 January 1908 - 1 April 1968) </strong>was a Soviet physicist who made fundamental contributions to many areas of theoretical physics.</li>
    <li><strong>His accomplishments include</strong> the independent co-discovery of the density matrix method in quantum mechanics (alongside John von Neumann), the quantum mechanical theory of diamagnetism, the theory of superfluidity, the theory of second-order phase transitions, the Ginzburg-Landau theory of superconductivity, the theory of Fermi liquid, the explanation of Landau damping in plasma physics, the Landau pole in quantum electrodynamics, the two-component theory of neutrinos, and Landau's equations for S matrix singularities. He received the 1962 Nobel Prize in Physics for his development of a mathematical theory of superfluidity that accounts for the properties of liquid helium II at a temperature below 2.17 K (-270.98 &degC).</li>
    <li><strong>1932 - 1937</strong> -National Scientific Center Kharkiv Institute of Physics and Technology, Kharkiv</li>
    <li><strong>Between 1932 and 1937</strong> Landau headed the Department of Theoretical Physics at the National Scientific Center Kharkiv Institute of Physics and Technology, and he lectured at the University of Kharkiv and the Kharkiv Polytechnical Institute. Apart from his theoretical accomplishments, Landau was the principal founder of a great tradition of theoretical physics in Kharkiv, Ukraine, sometimes referred to as the "Landau school". In Kharkiv, he and his friend and former student, Evgeny Lifshitz, began writing the Course of Theoretical Physics, ten volumes that together span the whole of the subject and are still widely used as graduate-level physics texts. During the Great Purge, Landau was investigated within the UPTI Affair in Kharkiv, but he managed to leave for Moscow to take up a new post.</li>
    <li><strong>Landau developed</strong> a famous comprehensive exam called the "Theoretical Minimum" which students were expected to pass before admission to the school. The exam covered all aspects of theoretical physics, and between 1934 and 1961 only 43 candidates passed, but those who did later became quite notable theoretical physicists.</li>
    <li><strong>1932</strong> - Landau computed the Chandrashekhar limit; however, he did not apply it to white dwarf stars.</li>
    <li><strong>Landau died on 1 April 1968, </strong>aged 60, from complications of the injuries sustained in the car accident he was involved in six years earlier. He was buried at the Novodevichy cemetery.</li>
